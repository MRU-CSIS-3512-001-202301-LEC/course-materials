## Instructor

![JP pic](images/jp-120x120.png)  
**name**: Jordan Pratt

**office**: My office in B103A at MRU; the door is located in the back of B103.

**email**: jpratt@mtroyal.ca

**phone**: 403.440.6745 (W)

**office hours**: 
- [my Google calendar if you're logged in to your MRU Google account](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=anByYXR0QG10cm95YWwuY2E)
- [my webpage calendar if you're not](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=jpratt@mtroyal.ca&ctz=America/Edmonton&mode=week)

_I do my best to keep my calendar up-to-date, so if my calendar says I'm on campus, I'll be on campus._

### Getting Help

I work full-time in the department as an instructional assistant (IA), supporting a bunch of courses, so I have expansive office hours! Take advantage of this, ok?

Please swing by my office when my calendar shows me as being on-campus. I even have a chair for guests. It's one of those crappy lab chairs, but it's still a chair **just for you**.

If you wish to talk to me online, then you can reach me online. Email is is preferred, though I _do_ hang out in the CAMRU Discord server. Don't expect immediate responses on Discord, because I am often helping people "live" during the day and might miss pings coming my way.

**_Please don't DM me on Discord outside of work hours - I use Discord for personal reasons (I do have a life! Kinda...) and when I'm using Discord after-hours, it's disruptive to have questions come in. Yeah, I guess I could have 2 different accounts, but my life is complicated enough._**

## Course Delivery

Unless otherwise specified, this course will be delivered synchronously and in-person during the scheduled course times. Regular attendance is expected and encouraged but not required.

Concepts will be explored and tested during lectures. 

Tutorial times will be used as a time where you can practice honing your skills with your instructor nearby to provide assistance. 

Outside of class times, students are expected to review the course materials, practice skills, and work on their project. Programming and problem-solving abilities can only be developed through active learning experiences, regular practice, and thoughtful reflection on the results. 

The instructor will use MRU Gmail exclusively for email communications. 

Students will be expected to regularly monitor the course’s Brightspace site, and other online resources for course communications.

## Course Materials

There is a recommended textbook as well as lab exercises for this course. 

### Textbook

Connolly and Hoar, _Fundamentals of Web Development, Third Edition_ (Pearson, 2022)

You'll be asked to read sections from the textbook in order to prepare for lectures, so you'll feel more prepared for lectures if you purchase the textbook. 

The textbook is only offered in a 12-month access eText, is annoying, but that is where the publishing company has taken us.

To get the text:

1. Visit https://www.pearson.com/en-ca.html
2. In the search box, enter Fundamentals of Web Development and select the book ($49.99 version).
3. Click the Buy Now button, which adds the ebook to the cart.
4. Enter postal code, which will add GST.
5. You can figure out the rest from there.


### Lab Exercises

You're able to purchase the exercises at: https://funwebdev3rd.gumroad.com/l/lab-set-one

For about $15, you get the lab exercises for chapters 3 through 14 of the textbook - these contain the starting and ending files for every lab exercise, so you can check your work. (Remember to give each exercise an honest effort before heading to the answer; otherwise, you're not really learning anything!)

> _If you're planning on taking Web 3, or looking to polish your Web 1 skills, this is a particularly good bargain._

While the purchase of the labs is not mandatory, if you don't pick them up, you'll want to find other ways to practice the skills required to succeed in the course.

Other important dates at MRU can be found [here](https://www.mtroyal.ca/academics/StudentRegistrationRecords/CriticalDates/index.php).

### Course Assessment Dates & Deadlines

The dates and deadlines for all things "worth marks" are available on our course's [D2L calendar page](https://learn.mru.ca/d2l/le/calendar/19338). 

_In a nutshell, you'll have quizzes every 2 weeks or so and the project is due about 12 weeks after the course starts._

---

## Assessments

| Assessment Name             | Weight |
|:----------------------------|-------:|
| Project                     |    20% |
| Mandatory Quizzes (5 @ 10%) |    50% |
| Optional No-risk Quiz       |      ➊ |
| Final Exam                  |    30% |

➊ _The optional no-risk quiz can be used to replace your lowest mandatory quiz - but only if you decide to take it. If you **do** take it, and the mark you get is **lower** than any of your mandatory quiz marks, then it **won't** be used to calculate your grade - hence the "no-risk" part._  

### Project (20%)

Problem-solving techniques and skills can only be acquired through practice and through the study of increasingly more difficult problems. The project is meant to provide this practice with the added benefit of producing something you can put in your portfolio.

The project will require weeks of steady work. To keep you on pace, you will be provided with a number of suggested milestones you should try to meet - or beat.

#### Project Feedback

I will be looking through the source code you have on GitHub periodically and providing you with feedback. Whether you act on this feedback or not is entirely up to you.

#### Project Late Policy

Since you have 12 weeks to finish the project, there will be no late submissions accepted. Full stop.

### Written Quizzes (5 x 10%)

Written quizzes are closed-book assessments that will be held during lecture times and take 40 minutes. (The remaining 40 minutes will be spent going over the quiz.)

The quizzes will focus on understanding and applying the concepts taught in class. They will primarily be made up of multiple-choice, true-false, and short answer style questions.

Students will not normally be permitted to write a missed written quiz at a later date. If a quiz **is** missed, the weighting of the missed quiz _may_ be shifted to a future quiz - but only at the instructor's discretion, based on the situation.

### Final Exam (30%)

The final exam will be a **3-hour exam** and will consist of a combination of written questions and coding done on paper.

## Being Successful in This Course

This course has a rep for being challenging. That's because it is - there is a **lot** of material covered and a **lot** of hours need to be put in to gain necessary skills and to create a satisfactory project.

There are some habits you can build to increase your chances of being successful in this course.

### Good Habits

- buying the textbook and keeping up with your readings in it
- buying the labs and working through them
- keeping up with - or exceeding - suggested milestones for the project
- punctually attending lectures and tutorials
- communicating with your instructor
- asking for help when you're struggling with something
- checking in on D2L regularly
- coming prepared for tutorials

***Consistent*** behaviour is the secret to success.

## Tutorials

_I'm currently tweaking this. Stay tuned._

## Required Technology

### Third-party Tools and Accounts

Rather than submitting the assignments to a university submit drive, you will be submitting code for marking on third-party sites such as GitHub, Netlify, and Google Cloud Platform. 

You will need to create accounts with these third-party sites and tools and accept the terms of service for developer access to these services. Students are advised that, if the site allows it, to limit personal information entered into the software as the data resides with the software company outside of the University.

In the event you do not wish to use a particular third-party party tool you can opt out. Do note that this will require you to research and suggest an alternative service, which may be acceptable depending on the characteristics of the tool. You agree that the instructor will have sole authority to decide if an alternative is acceptable.

If any of this gives you pause, you should consider withdrawing from the course now, while you can still have your fees refunded.

### Hardware

You'll need a computer over which you have administrative control, since you'll be installing some software on it.

The tools we'll be using are cross-platform, so it won't matter whether you're using a Windows, Linux, or Mac machine. The system requirements for these tools are pretty low, so most machines purchased within the last 4 years or so should be perfectly fine. If you have any concerns, it's best to reach out to me and we'll talk.

### Software

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, cross-platform text editor that has become very commonly used in our industry. I strongly recommend that you install it and use it for your coursework.

If you wish to do your work with some other editor, I won't stop you - but I won't provide any tech support either. :) 

#### Git Client

We'll be using GitHub (and therefore Git) these ways in our course:

1. code that I use in lecture will be made available as public repositories
2. ditto for code used in tutorials
3. your project source code will be in a GitHub repo that I will have access to

All this means you need to be able to run Git commands on your computer. You can follow [these instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to get your computer Git-ready, if it's not already. If you have an older version of GitHub on your machine, I would recommend updating it.

#### GitHub Codespaces

I thought I'd give this a try this semester; you can read up on what Codespaces is [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Misc Course Policies

### Attendance

There is **no attendance requirement** in this course - I **won't** deduct marks if you don't show up for lectures or tutorials. 

That being said, education research shows - conclusively - that **just showing up and paying some attention** is one of the best things you can do to be successful in any course.

### Technical Issues

A **student’s** technical difficulties will **not** usually be an acceptable excuse for late submissions. Start early, back up your work, and don't tempt fate.

**MRU'S** technical difficulties **may** warrant modifications to due dates/times. This is at the instructor's discretion and modifications will be communicated as soon as reasonably possible once the issue has been examined.

### Illness and Unforeseen Circumstances

Serious illness or other unforeseen circumstances that might have an effect on submissions will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Communicate with me early and clearly if something serious is happening in your life and we'll work something out.

Last-minute communications will likely be met with some resistance.

## University Policies

### Student Code of Conduct

Students and faculty at MRU share an important responsibility to maintain the integrity of the teaching and learning relationship.  This relationship is characterized by honesty, fairness and mutual respect for the aim and principles of the pursuit of education. Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by MRU’s regulations described by the [Code of Student Academic Integrity](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eYaSdlbVm93YQzAGg7ls6jB4sBJ0zgLN/view) and the related [Code of Student Academic Integrity Procedures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cMJSt_oTQmr5NSq9XncgCqrk8MTII_Du/view) which set out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, non-academic misconduct, students’ rights and responsibilities. 

Academic misconduct impedes the activities of the university community and is punishable by appropriate disciplinary action. Academic misconduct includes: plagiarism, cheating, falsification, fabrication, misrepresentation, and/or engaging in actions that provide unfair academic advantage. Inappropriate actions include copying or allowing one’s own work to be copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and tests, submitting work prepared in collaboration with others OR with artificial intelligence agents, and other such actions. A lack of familiarity with MRU’s regulations on academic conduct does not constitute a defense against its application. Additional resources and tools for students can be found at the [Office of Student Community Standards](https://www.mtroyal.ca/CampusServices/CampusResources/StudentCommunityStandards/index.htm). 

I really like what Harvard's CS50X course has to say about [academic honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/honesty/). It's a bit easier to digest than some of the official MRU policies and makes sense to my brain:

> _The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. **Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy’s other constraints.**_

### The AI Wrinkle

Recent advances in AI-based software designed to suggest/complete lines of code - or entire solutions to a problem - are making things...interesting for many educational institutions.

Just so we're clear: the use of AI tools is considered a form of plagiarism! If you **are** found to be using such tools on your project, it will be considered academic misconduct and I'll proceed accordingly.

## Notifications

### Grade Disputes

Disputes or concerns about student grades need to be immediately directed to the instructor responsible for assigning grades. If no resolution can be reached, students have the ability to appeal their final grades following the [Appeals and Grievance](https://catalog.mtroyal.ca/content.php?catoid=29&navoid=2314#academic-appeals-and-grievances) process outlined in the Academic Calendar.

### Matching Software

In this course, your code submissions will be compared using [compare50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/projects/compare50/en/latest/). This is a program that checks textual material for originality. MRU authorizes the use of text matching software for educational purposes. Submitted data resides on University servers and is used to provide comparisons that promote academic integrity. Anonymized versions of these submissions may be retained for comparison in future semesters.

More information can be found by reading the University’s [matching software policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2rB1ncpgWxvX3YwS0xrbnJ6Y3M/view?resourcekey=0-W7U8zurwUF7rC8BcwMUj9w).

### Third-party Apps

Students will be using third-party vendor software applications: both downloaded to a student’s computer and as online services. 

You are advised that by using them you are consenting to the potential disclosure of your personal information to external vendors which fall outside the custody and control of Mount Royal University. Limited identifiable personal information should be entered into these applications to protect your personal privacy.

Students have the right to opt out of using the matching/third-party software. Alternative forms of originality checking and academic participation are subject to the agreement of the instructor. Students must notify their instruction of their intention to opt out explicitly (an email from your MRU Gmail account) by the end of the first month of classes.

## Academic Accommodations

### Disability-Related Accommodations

Students registered with Access and Inclusion Services and have an Academic Accommodation Letter should schedule a private conversation with me, as soon as possible, to discuss how your accommodations will be implemented into the design of this course. A conversation may take place in-person, online, or over the phone. Requests to discuss accommodations during or between classes will not be accepted. Acknowledgement of your accommodations will then be provided via email or Faculty Acknowledgement Form, depending on course delivery method. 

If you are a student who experiences disability-related barriers and has not registered with Access and Inclusion Services, you may wish to inquire about services by [contacting the Access and Inclusion Services office directly](https://www.mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/ResourcesServices/AccessibilityServices/ContactUs/index.htm).

### Non-Disability-Related Accommodations

Students requiring non-disability-related academic accommodations (as related to the protected grounds in Human Rights Legislation) are encouraged to contact Access and Inclusion Services to explore what academic accommodations may be available to assist them in order to participate fully in their academic studies. 

You may wish to inquire about services by [contacting the Access and Inclusion Services office directly](https://www.mtroyal.ca/AcademicSupport/ResourcesServices/AccessibilityServices/ContactUs/index.htm).
